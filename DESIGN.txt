1) getImages could be in ImageStore class because it uses the ImageStore attributes, however it felt more comfortable
to leave it in Functions since it didnt really make that much of a difference.

2) getNumFromRange can be in multiple classes since it doesnt really have any special variables. However it can also
remain static in the functions, so it really can have a place anywhere. I put it in entity since it uses it the most.

3) moveEntity could either be in WorldModel or entity since it uses both in its parameters and both drive the code,
however I chose for it to be in Entity since it felt better to put it there. Mainly because of its name.
